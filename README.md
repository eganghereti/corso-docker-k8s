### Provision Cluster with K3d

The first step is to ensure that the docker engine is running on your machine. Once you've verified that, you can proceed to create a cluster with the following command:

``` bash
k3d cluster create example-cluster --servers 3 --agents 2
```

### Delete Cluster with K3d

You can delete a cluster with the following command:

``` bash
k3d cluster delete example-cluster
```
